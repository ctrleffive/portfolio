## 🤔 Who is this for?
- If you are looking for a simple service that can transfer files and data between devices, this is it. No need to share your WhatsApp number or email ID to strangers.

## 🙋‍♂️ How to use?
1. Open `p2p.chandujs.com` on both of your devices.
2. Each time you open the app, you will see a big emoji. That's your ID.
3. If you are seeing `waiting for devices...` make sure the other device is online and the app's window is in focus.
4. On any of the devices, click on the device's emoji you want to connect from the list.
5. You can just start typing on the input box if you want. It will appear on the other side in real-time.
6. Choose a file or drag & drop any file to transfer.
