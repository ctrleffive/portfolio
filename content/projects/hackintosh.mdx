# Ô£ø Hackintosh
This repository contains OpenCore EFI files for the ASUS Prime Z490M-Plus motherboard.

I will update this repository as I upgrade to the latest versions of macOS. Anything on the 'main' branch is what I'm currently using. You can also find version tags.

I hope this repository will help others who are looking to build a Hackintosh with the same hardware and software configuration.

If you want to build a Hackintosh for yourself, I highly recommend going through the [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) itself. You will have to go through the instructions multiple times. I spent a lot of time figuring out the errors I made at various points, and I can share those to help others so they don't make the same mistakes and hopefully save a lot of time and frustration.
